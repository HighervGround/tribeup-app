# matching-algorithms

Core matching system components:

1. Game Discovery Algorithm 
Importance Score: 95/100
Location: src/lib/supabaseService.ts

- Multi-factor game matching using:
  - Sport preference weighting
  - Location proximity (5-25 mile radius)
  - Player skill level compatibility
  - Time slot availability
  - Weather conditions for outdoor sports

2. Player Skill Matching
Importance Score: 85/100
Location: src/components/GameDetails.tsx

- Sport-specific skill level assessment
- Historical performance analysis
- Dynamic skill adjustments based on game outcomes
- Balanced team formation for team sports
- Skill range restrictions for competitive games

3. Location-Based Clustering
Importance Score: 80/100
Location: src/components/MapView.tsx

- Geographic game clustering by:
  - Sport type zones
  - Player density areas
  - Venue availability
  - Time slot distribution
- Dynamic radius adjustment based on player density

4. Weather-Aware Scheduling
Importance Score: 75/100
Location: src/lib/weatherService.ts

- Sport-specific weather condition thresholds
- Outdoor activity suitability scoring
- Alternative venue suggestions for weather impacts
- Automatic rescheduling recommendations

Key Business Rules:

1. Game Matching
- Maximum skill level difference: 2 levels
- Minimum 4 players for team sports
- Maximum travel radius based on sport type
- Required skill level verification for competitive games

2. Location Clustering
- Minimum 3 active games for cluster formation
- Maximum 10 mile radius for urban clusters
- Sport-specific venue requirements
- Public transport accessibility scoring

3. Schedule Optimization
- Peak hours prioritization (6-9pm weekdays)
- Weekend morning preference for outdoor sports
- Weather-based time slot adjustments
- Venue availability constraints
