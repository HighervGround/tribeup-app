# Frontend Aesthetics Rules

## Avoid Generic "AI Slop" Aesthetics

You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight while respecting TribeUp's brand identity.

## Typography

**Use distinctive, interesting fonts** that elevate the frontend's aesthetics. However, **respect TribeUp's existing system font stack** for performance and consistency.

**When custom fonts are appropriate:**
- For marketing pages, landing pages, or special features
- Choose fonts that complement the energetic, sports-focused brand
- Consider: **Syne**, **DM Sans**, **Space Grotesk**, **Satoshi**, **Cabinet Grotesk**
- Avoid: Inter, Roboto, Arial, generic system fonts (unless using system stack for performance)

**For app components:**
- Use the existing system font stack for optimal performance
- Maintain the established typographic scale (14px base, modular scale)
- Use weight extremes (400 vs 700/800) for hierarchy, not 400 vs 500

## Color & Theme

**Commit to TribeUp's cohesive UF brand aesthetic:**
- **Primary**: UF Orange (#FA4616) - use decisively, not timidly
- **Secondary**: UF Blue (#0021A5) - for supporting elements
- **Accents**: Use UF brand colors (bottlebrush, alachua, gator) with confidence
- **Sport colors**: Use for categorization, create visual interest through contrast

**Color principles:**
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Use CSS variables from `globals.css` for consistency
- Create depth with gradients and layered backgrounds
- Dark mode: Use established dark theme variables

**Avoid:**
- Generic purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Clichéd color schemes that don't match UF brand
- Overly safe, evenly-distributed color palettes

## Motion & Animation

**Use animations for effects and micro-interactions:**
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML/static pages
- Use Motion library (Framer Motion) for React components
- Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions

**Animation principles:**
- Use `animation-delay` for staggered reveals
- Smooth transitions for state changes (hover, focus, active)
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- Reference existing animation patterns in `src/MOTION_SYSTEM.md`

**Examples:**
- Page load: Staggered fade-in with translateY
- Cards: Subtle hover lift with shadow increase
- Buttons: Ripple or scale effects on interaction
- Lists: Staggered entrance animations

## Backgrounds

**Create atmosphere and depth** rather than defaulting to solid colors:
- Layer CSS gradients using UF brand colors
- Use geometric patterns that complement the sports/community theme
- Add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic
- Consider subtle textures or mesh gradients for hero sections

**Background patterns:**
- Sports-themed: Subtle court lines, field patterns
- Community: Organic shapes mixed with technical elements
- Energy: Dynamic gradients that suggest movement

## Component Design

**Make distinctive, context-appropriate choices:**
- Vary card designs: rounded corners, subtle shadows, border accents
- Use UF brand colors creatively: orange gradients, blue accents
- Create visual hierarchy through size, weight, and color contrast
- Avoid cookie-cutter component patterns

**Examples:**
- Game cards: Use sport-specific color accents, dynamic hover states
- Buttons: Vary styles (rounded, pill-shaped, outlined) based on context
- Modals: Consider backdrop blur, subtle animations
- Lists: Staggered animations, interesting empty states

## What to Avoid

**Generic AI-generated aesthetics:**
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial) - unless part of system stack
- Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white) that don't match UF brand
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character
- Timid, safe design choices that blend into generic web apps

## Brand Consistency

**While being creative, always:**
- Use UF brand colors from `globals.css` CSS variables
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Respect the established design system in `src/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
- Keep mobile-first responsive design
- Use existing component patterns from `src/shared/components/ui/`

## Interpretation

**Think creatively and make unexpected choices** that feel genuinely designed for TribeUp's sports community context:
- Sports energy: Dynamic, energetic animations
- Community warmth: Friendly, approachable color combinations
- University spirit: Bold, confident use of UF colors
- Modern tech: Clean interfaces with thoughtful details

**Vary your approach:**
- Don't converge on the same choices across generations
- Think outside the box while respecting brand guidelines
- Make context-specific decisions that enhance the user experience
