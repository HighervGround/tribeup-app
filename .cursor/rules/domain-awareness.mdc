# Domain Awareness Rules

## Domain Structure
Code is organized by business domain:
- `src/domains/games/` - Game Management System (core feature)
- `src/domains/users/` - User Engagement
- `src/domains/locations/` - Location Services
- `src/domains/weather/` - Weather Integration
- `src/domains/tribes/` - Tribe/Social Features

## Before Making Changes
1. **Identify the domain** you're working in
2. **Check domain `.cursorrules`** file: `src/domains/[domain]/.cursorrules`
3. **Read domain README**: `src/domains/[domain]/README.md`
4. **Understand domain boundaries** - what it's responsible for vs. not

## Domain-Specific Rules
Each domain has its own `.cursorrules` file with:
- Domain boundaries (what it handles vs. doesn't)
- Key components, hooks, and services
- Business rules (e.g., 2-hour game modification rule)
- Common patterns and examples

## Cross-Domain Imports
When importing from other domains:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Cross-domain import
import { WeatherWidget } from '@/domains/weather/components/WeatherWidget';
import { MapView } from '@/domains/locations/components/MapView';
```
