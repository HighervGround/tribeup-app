# Pattern Matching Rules

## Always Reference Similar Code
When adding features or making changes:
1. **Find similar existing code** in the codebase
2. **Point to specific files and line numbers**
3. **Follow the same patterns** (structure, error handling, styling)
4. **Use `@` mentions** to include related files for context

## Example Pattern Matching
```
Before suggesting changes, reference:
- Similar components: "Follow the pattern from GameDetails.tsx line 150"
- Similar hooks: "Use the same structure as useGameActions.ts"
- Similar services: "Follow error handling from gameParticipantService.ts"
```

## Component Patterns
- Use existing UI components from `@/shared/components/ui/`
- Follow styling patterns (Tailwind classes, Radix UI components)
- Match button variants, card structures, modal patterns

## Hook Patterns
- React Query for data fetching
- Optimistic updates for mutations
- Real-time subscriptions for live data
- Error handling with toast notifications

## Service Patterns
- Pure functions for business logic
- Explicit error handling
- Consistent response shapes
- Use Supabase client from `@/core/database/supabase`
